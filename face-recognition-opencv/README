1. crop faces in data set images, resize into (128, 128)
            python crop_face.py

2. manually clean the data set

3. create training and test sets
            python init_dataset_meta.py

4. train, save a model --> test accuracies
            python train_test.py


# genenal procedure to build a Machine Learning based model
1. prepare a data set (clean, well-labeled)
2. analyze characteristics/ distribution of the data set
3. propose an architecture/model
4. implemnt --> train --> test --> wrong predictions/cases
5. analyze wrong predictions/cases --> update models --> [Step 4]
6. report --> conclusion
